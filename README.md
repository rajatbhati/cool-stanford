# COOL-stanford
## Intro:
This project is a part of the assignments required to complete the COMPILERS course by stanford. COOL - Classroom Object Oriented Language is cretaed for the purpose of teaching students to create Compilers .


## Details
The Course requires us to make a complete compiler for COOL .

The files in this project are the main files for the final assignment (since all others can be derived from the same). since stanford already provides the links for the other support files hence it is redundant to provide the same files here.

## Languages used
* [C]
